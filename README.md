Have you had this problem when you try to schedule a new service, let's say with Verizon, Cox etc.  They have sold you a service and now you just have to have a technitian to come and connect/install the hardware etc.   For an example, sales person will get your phone # and let you know that technician will come Mon, Tue from 12 PM to 3 PM.    It is difficult to block half a day to get the service installed and inconvenient. And then when the time comes, technician might be busy/ traffic etc. and does not show up.    You will be upset becuase you have wasted so much time.  Solution would be to have a tracker(smartphone) with technicitan and have him notify you when he is about (15,20,30 min from you) (you can choose this option).   You will recieve the text (or email notification).  #Business reasoning:  Providers spend a lot of money to advertise and reach out to you as a customer and have you switch from another provider, but fail most of the time at the last step of the sale
